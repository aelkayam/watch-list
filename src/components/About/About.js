              Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by animated film directors Isao
              Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, and has produced twenty-two
              feature-length films. Most Studio Ghibli films ranked number one
              at the box office in Japan in the year in which they were
              released. SPIRITED AWAY, directed by Hayao Miyazaki and released
              in 2001, is the all-time highest grossing film in Japan, earning
              over 30 billion yen at the box office.
